Your GSI will be sending out a form to match you up with a partner for this project. You may also indicate if you're working alone or have already found a partner and do not need to be paired up. This form is **mandatory** - please fill it out before submitting your lab. Set `submitted` to `True` once you've submitted the form.\n",

    "2. For students enrolled in <span style=\"color: #04888B\">**Self Service**</span>, you have the option to work with a partner who is in self-service. You can use this [edThread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/64093/discussion/5295836) to find a partner if you want one. If you wish to work alone, no further action is required. Please set `submitted` to `True` to get credit for this problem.\n",
